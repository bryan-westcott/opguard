name: PR and Dispatch Checks
# Run code quality checks and run tests
# Each step will check for relevant file changes (or dispatch workflow trigger)

# How to use:
#   Add ruleset for dev to check for two successful status checks for PR push:
#     * "Run All Code Quality Checks in PR"
#     * "Docker Images Test Build in PR"

  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
  push:
    branches:
      - ci-cd # use this to test before merging with main

  # Run pytest tests (requires GPU for reasonable coverage)
  # This is the most expensive step, so only run if all other tests pass
